Within this directory are experiments I'm making in an attempt to grapple with the complexity of the stride editor.
Each experiment deals with a minimally reproducible technical problem that the editor must solve for.

Some ideas:

1. use a command pattern to edit a tree data structure
2. create a system for recognizing key sequences and interpret them according to a semantic hierarchy
3. render a tree data structure to the DOM
4. use web components to render tree nodes in isolation
5. make an iframe zoomable and pannable
6. use CRDTs to allow for collaborative tree editing
