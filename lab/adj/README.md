this lab explores the use of an adjacency list to represent a DOM tree.
some features I want:

- create/update/delete
- traversal: next, previous, parent, child
- multi-node editing

some advanced features I may try to target:

- command-based editing with diff capture
- undo/redo (dependent on above)
- dom and cssom updates as downstream effects
